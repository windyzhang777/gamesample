Per Jason Comments:
DO NOT TRUST THESE INTERFACES. Many of these interfaces will cause all kinds of problems if we use them from the client side. For example we should never be calling PlayFabServer.d.ts apis for obvious reasons. However some of the trickier ones would include PlayFabAuthenticiation; that is never directly used in our code but rather is used when trying to build an admin site that manages permissions however some parts of it are also leveraged by PlayFabClient.d.ts so small pieces of it will be used in our app. Without studying the APIs here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/client/?view=playfab-rest you cannot know what of these are interfaces are actually allowable on the client side.
